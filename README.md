Acquiring habits that stick can be difficult. Githo helps you by letting you gradually advance, instead of going from 0 to 100%. This principle borrows ideas from exposure therapy.

Define the steps towards your final habit, then start with the first one. Advance to the next step by consistently succeeding. If a step is too difficult (= if success isn't consistent), repeat the one before it.

Such a gradual acquisition **reduces the physical/mental strain** and **helps you create a routine long before arriving at the final habit**.

## Example of a Habit-Plan:
### Final Habit:
Go jogging every morning
### Steps:
Every morning...
1. Week: Just step outside on the street, then return home.
2. Week: Take a short walk.
3. Week: Take a longer walk 
4. Week: Take a longer walk and add short jogging-segments into the mix
5. Week: Go jogging
