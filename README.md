# Githo - Get Into The Habit Ofâ€¦

*An app that helps you form long-lasting habits, one step at a time.*

Aquiring habits that stick can be difficult. Githo helps you by letting you gradually advance, instead of going from 0 to 100%. This principle borrows ideas from exposure therapy.

## Example:
### Final Habit:
Go jogging every morning
## Steps:
Every morning...
**Week 1:** Just step outside on the street, then return home.
**Week 2:** Take a short walk.
**Week 3:** Take a longer walk 
**Week 4:** Take a longer walk and add short jogging-segments into the mix
**Week 5:** Go jogging

Such a gradual acquisition **reduces the physical/mental strain** and **helps you create a routine way arriving at the actual habit, strengthening it**.
