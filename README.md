# Githo

_**G**et **I**nto **T**he **H**abit **O**f… An app in which you level up towards your final habit._

Acquiring habits that stick can be difficult. Githo helps you by letting you gradually advance, instead of going from 0 to 100%. This principle borrows ideas from exposure therapy.

Define levels of your final habit, going from easy to hard. Then start with the first one. Level up by consistently succeeding. If a level is too difficult (= if success isn't consistent), repeat the previous one.

Such a gradual acquisition **reduces the physical/mental strain** and helps you **create a routine long before arriving at the final habit**.

4. Week: Take a longer walk and add short jogging-segments into the mix
5. Week: Go jogging
