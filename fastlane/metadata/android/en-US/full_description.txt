Acquiring habits that stick can be difficult. Githo helps you by letting you gradually advance, instead of going from 0 to 100%. This principle borrows ideas from exposure therapy.

Define the steps towards your final habit, then start with the first one. Advance to the next step by consistently succeeding. If a step is too difficult (= if success isn't consistent), repeat the one before it.

Such a gradual acquisition reduces the physical/mental strain and helps you create a routine long before arriving at the final habit.
