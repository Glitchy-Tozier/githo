Acquiring habits that stick can be difficult. Githo helps you by letting you gradually advance, instead of going from 0 to 100%.
This principle borrows ideas from exposure therapy.

Define the steps towards your final habit, then start with the first one. Advance to the next step by consistently succeeding. If a step is too difficult (= if success isn't consistent), repeat the one before it.

Such a gradual acquisition reduces the physical/mental strain and helps you create a routine long before arriving at the final habit.

<strong>Example of a Habit-Plan:</strong>
Final Habit: <i>Go jogging every morning</i>
<strong>Steps:</strong> <i>Every morning...</i>
<ul>
  <li>
    <b>Week 1:</b> Just step outside on the street, then return home.
  </li>
  <li>
    <b>Week 2:</b> Take a walk around your house/building.
  </li>
  <li>
    <b>Week 3:</b> Take a walk spanning 3-5 buildings.
  </li>
  <li>
    <b>Week 4:</b> Take a longer walk and add short jogging-segments into the mix.
  </li>
  <li>
    <b>Week 5:</b> Go jogging. Well done.
  </li>
</ul>
