Acquiring habits that stick can be difficult. Githo helps you by letting you gradually advance, instead of going from 0 to 100%.
This principle borrows ideas from exposure therapy.

Define levels of your final habit, going from easy to hard. Then start with the first one. Level up by consistently succeeding. If a level is too difficult (= if success isn't consistent), repeat the previous one.

Such a gradual acquisition <b>reduces the physical/mental strain</b> and helps you <b>create a routine long before arriving at the final habit</b>.

<strong>Example of a Habit-Plan:</strong>
Final Habit: <i>Go jogging every morning</i>
<strong>Levels:</strong> <i>Every morning...</i>
<ul>
  <li><b>Week 1:</b> Just step outside on the street, then return home.</li>
  <li><b>Week 2:</b> Take a walk around your house/building.</li>
  <li><b>Week 3:</b> Take a walk spanning 3-5 buildings.</li>
  <li><b>Week 4:</b> Take a longer walk and add short jogging-segments into the mix.</li>
  <li><b>Week 5:</b> Go jogging. Well done.</li>
</ul>
