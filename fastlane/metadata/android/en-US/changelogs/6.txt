This update was only concerned with bug-fixes.
• Fixed confusing bug where the user got shown an outdated version of his score
• Fixed horrible bug where the user got penalized way too hard for not completing a training-period
• Fixed ugly bug where completed training-periods didn't actually get marked as such
